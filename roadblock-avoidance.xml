        non-compliant infrastructure.  It poses potential detection and

    <section title="Background">
      <t>Deployment of DNSSEC today is hampered by network
      architectures that make it difficult or sometimes impossible for
      validating stub resolvers to effectively obtain the DNSSEC data
      they need.  This occurs because neighboring recursive resolvers
      are not fully DNSSEC compliant, or because "middle-boxes" active
      block outbound traffic to the DNS port (53).</t>
      <t>This document talks about ways of detecting the state of the
      network a validating stub resolver might be attached to, and
      ways to hopefully circumvent the problems associated with the
      network defects it discovers.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Detecting DNSSEC Non-Compilance">
      <t>A validating stub resolver must fist determine what
      bottlenecks exist that may hamper its ability to perform DNSSEC
      lookups.  This section outlines tests that can be done to test
      certain features of the surrounding network.</t>
      <section title="Determining DNSSEC support in neighboring
	recursive resolvers">
	<t>Ideally, a validating stub resolver can make use of the
	caching present in neighboring recursive resolvers.  This
	section discusses the tests that such a recursive resolver
	must pass in order to be fully usable as a near-by DNS
	cache.</t>

      <section title="Direct Network Queries">
	<t>If need be, a validating stub resolver may need to make
	direct queries to authoritative servers in order to collect
	the data they require.  To do that, a number of key network
	features must be functional.</t>

    <section title="Roadblock Avoidance">
      <t>Once we have determined what level of support is available in
      the neighboring network, we can determine what must be done in
      order to effectively act as a validating resolver.  This section
      discusses some of the options available given the results from
      the previous sections.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document discusses problems that may occur while
      deploying the secure DNSSEC protocol and what mitigations can be
      used to help detect and midigate these problems.  Following
      these suggestions should result in a more secure DNSSEC
      operational environment than if DNSSEC was simply disabled when
      it fails to perform as expected.</t>
